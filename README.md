To run Three Tier Application using Docker, we need to first create a Full Stack Project. We can use any of our Full Stack Project but if we donâ€™t have one then we can use someone else project also. Here, I have used a very easy simple project on GitLab.This project is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express and MongoDB.<br>
First you need to clone the Project Repository from the link using command:
git clone https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/developing-with-docker <br>
To run a Three Tier Application, we need to run three Docker Containers simultaneously. So, it is necessary to run all these containers inside a network to avoid their interaction with other containers. 
So, Network can be created by using the following command after starting the Docker Engine with name mongo-network
